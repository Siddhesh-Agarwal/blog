## id() in python

In this post, I will try to improve your idea about memory in python using the in-built `id()` function. For those of you who don't know what `id()` is:

>  The `id()` function returns a unique ID of the object. All objects in python have a unique ID and no 2 different values correspond to the same ID.

So let us begin with a small example:

```py
a = b = 500
print(id(a) == id(b))
```

> **Fun fact:** In python, `id(a) == id(b)` is analogous to `a is b`.

The above code prints `True` because python creates the variable `b` with the value `500` and then creates a variable `a` pointing to the value of `b`. This implies that `a` and `b` are pointing towards the same memory location and hence the same ID.

<hr>

Now let's raise the bar:

```py
a = 500
b = 500
print(id(a) == id(b))
```

The above code prints `False` because: 

* Python creates a variable `a` pointing to the value `500` in the memory. 
* Then, it creates another variable `b` pointing to another value `500` (yeah, both 500 are different).

Hence, both have different IDs because both point toward different memory locations.

<hr>

I hope this isn't confusing because there is more to come. Guess the output for this:

```py
a = 50
b = 50
print(id(a) == id(b))
```

Some of you may think _"This is the previous question with different values. I know the answer is `False`"_ but not so fast.

For small integers (The CPython range is -5 to 256, both inclusive), then integer objects (`<class 'int'>`) are shared. This is done entirely to save space. The memory imprint of the console would be significantly larger if these objects werenâ€™t sharing their memory.

So the correct answer is `True`

<hr>

Okay, okay. Just one more to go. The last one:

```py
a = 500
id1 = id(a)
a = 500
id2 = id(a)
print(id1 == id2)
```

Well, even though I am re-declaring the same variable with the same value, the answer is **most likely** to be `False`. I'll explain to you why. When you re-declare a variable in python, the interpreter works in the same way as a declaration. i.e. It entirely deletes the previous existing value and creates a variable with the new value. So when we give `a = 500`, the second time the interpreter deletes the previously existing value of `a` and creates a new memory location for `500` where `a` would point towards. Both of these IDs are most likely different.

SO, the answer is `False`.

**NOTE:** If the above example had a number belonging to the inclusive range -5 to 256, the answer would have been `True`. this is because numbers belonging to the inclusive range have a fixed memory location.
